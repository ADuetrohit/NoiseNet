IoT-Based Noise Monitoring System using ESP32 and INMP441:

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller and an INMP441 I²S digital microphone to measure environmental noise levels in real time. The ESP32 processes microphone data, estimates noise intensity, and hosts a web server that can be accessed from any smartphone or computer on the same Wi-Fi network. Users can view live noise readings and environment status (Quiet, Moderate, Loud) directly in their browser, making it useful for applications in classrooms, smart homes, industries, and urban noise monitoring.

 Pin Configuration

INMP441 Pin  |	ESP32 GPIO (from code)  |      Function
VCC	     |    3.3V	                |     Power supply
GND	     |     GND	                |     Ground
WS (LRCL)    |	GPIO25	                |  Word Select (Left/Right clock)
SD (DOUT)    |	GPIO32                  |   Serial Data output
SCK (BCLK)   |	GPIO26                  |     Bit Clock
L/R          |   GND = Left channel   	|    Channel select


Important Notes:

INMP441 works only at 3.3V logic (don’t connect to 5V).
If you want the microphone to act as Left channel, connect L/R → GND.
If you want Right channel, connect L/R → 3.3V.
